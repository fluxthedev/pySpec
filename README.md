# pySpec
PySpec is a musical analysis tool written in Python that will do the following:
1. Read Spectrogram Data from CSV
2. Preprocess spectrogram data (Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation and noise reduction)
3. Extracts chords and notes
4. Creates a guitar MusicXML tablature file

In the future, I would ideally like to harness the power of machine learning and neural networks (maybe even make a custom model)

**Disclaimer** This app was made using ChatGPT-4 using prompt engineering methods and my software engineering intuition. I did not write any of this code by hand. I started this out of curiosity and to provide an alternative for a paid tool
