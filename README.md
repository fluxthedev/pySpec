# pySpec
The goal of pySpec is to provide others (and myself) with a tool to read a spectrogram and audio file of a song, then build out the tablature for it in MusicXML.
Some apps do this currently, but they cost money. For now and in the foreseeable future this app with not. Ideally, when it is practical (financially and time-wise), 
I would like to use/make a Large Language Model (or another relevant model) to make things more efficient and accurate.

P.S. More built out read me is coming soon!
